# Product Catalog & Cart System - Assignment Deliverables

## Project Overview

This project implements a full-stack e-commerce application with a product catalog, shopping cart functionality, product bundles, and an admin dashboard. The system was built using modern web technologies with a focus on scalability, user experience, and maintainability.

## Repository & Deployment

- **Repository**: [GitHub Repository Link]
- **Deployed Version**: [Deployed Application Link]
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

## Development Process & Product Decisions

### Phase 1: Initial System Design & Planning

**Initial Approach:**
After receiving the assignment, I did a quick system design analysis to determine what tech stack to use, along with data model design and sample APIs.

I used GPT to summarize the requirements and then used Cursor to create a detailed implementation plan for an MVP version of the app. Then I asked Cursor to begin building out the MVP version using my preferred stack of Nextjs with React + TailwindCSS, using a clean design with shadcn, and also using Supabase.

**Key Decisions Made:**

#### 1. Technology Stack Selection

**Next.js 15 (App Router)**
- **Why**: Server-side rendering capabilities, built-in API routes, seamless Vercel deployment
- **Trade-offs**: Chose App Router over Pages Router for better performance and modern React patterns
- **Benefits**: Built-in optimization, automatic code splitting, and excellent developer experience

**React 19 + TypeScript**
- **Why**: Type safety, better developer experience, and future-proofing
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly more verbose than JavaScript, but significantly reduces runtime errors
- **Benefits**: Enhanced IDE support, better refactoring capabilities, and improved code maintainability

**Supabase (PostgreSQL)**
- **Why**: Fast setup, built-in authentication, real-time capabilities, and excellent developer experience
- **Trade-offs**: Vendor lock-in vs. self-hosted PostgreSQL, but the speed of development outweighed concerns
- **Benefits**: Instant APIs, Row Level Security, real-time subscriptions, and built-in file storage

**Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**
- **Why**: Rapid UI development, consistent design system, and excellent component library
- **Trade-offs**: Larger bundle size vs. custom CSS, but development speed was prioritized
- **Benefits**: Responsive design, accessibility features, and modern component patterns

#### 2. Data Model Design

**Core Tables:**
- `products`: Individual products with pricing, inventory, and metadata
- `bundle_products`: Many-to-many relationship for product bundles
- `cart_items`: Session-based cart management
- `admin_users`: Admin authentication system

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Session-based Cart**: Chose session IDs over user authentication for guest users
- **Bundle Relationships**: Implemented parent-child relationships with quantity ratios
- **Row Level Security**: Used Supabase RLS for data protection
- **UUID Primary Keys**: For better scalability and security

### Phase 2: Feature-by-Feature Implementation

#### Feature 1: Product Catalog + Cart System

**Implementation Approach:**
- Created core product display components with responsive design
- Implemented React Context for cart state management
- Built API routes for product fetching and cart operations
- Used optimistic updates for better user experience

**Key Decisions:**
- **Context vs. Redux**: Chose React Context for simplicity and built-in React patterns
- **Local Storage**: Initially used localStorage for cart persistence, later migrated to Supabase
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with reusable ProductCard and CartSidebar components

**AI Assistance:**
- Used Cursor to generate initial component structure
- Leveraged AI for TypeScript type definitions and error handling
- AI helped optimize component performance and accessibility

#### Feature 2: Product Bundles

**Implementation Approach:**
- Extended data model to support bundle relationships
- Created BundleCard component with collapsible child product display
- Implemented bundle savings calculation and display
- Added bundle stock calculation based on minimum child product availability

**Key Decisions:**
- **Bundle Stock Logic**: Stock = min(child_product_stock / quantity_ratio) across all child products
- **Quantity Ratios**: Flexible system allowing different quantities per child product
- **UI/UX**: Collapsible design to show bundle contents without overwhelming the interface

**AI Assistance:**
- AI helped design the complex bundle stock calculation algorithm
- Generated SQL queries for bundle product relationships
- Assisted with responsive design for bundle display

#### Feature 3: Quantity Management

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implemented proportional quantity scaling for bundles
- Added quantity selectors in product detail modals
- Created cart quantity management with add/remove functionality
- Implemented bundle quantity logic based on child product availability

**Key Decisions:**
- **Proportional Scaling**: Bundle quantities scale based on child product ratios
- **Cart Counting**: Count unique items, not total quantities
- **Stock Validation**: Real-time stock checking before adding to cart

**AI Assistance:**
- AI helped implement complex quantity calculation logic
- Generated cart state management patterns
- Assisted with quantity validation and error handling

#### Feature 4: Pricing

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implemented dynamic pricing calculation for bundles
- Added bundle savings display and comparison
- Created total price calculation for cart items
- Implemented price formatting and currency display

**Key Decisions:**
- **Bundle Pricing**: Calculate based on individual product prices and quantities
- **Savings Display**: Show percentage and dollar amount saved with bundles
- **Price Formatting**: Consistent currency formatting across the application

**AI Assistance:**
- AI helped design pricing calculation algorithms
- Generated price formatting utilities
- Assisted with bundle savings display logic

#### Feature 5: Admin Layer

**Implementation Approach:**
- Built custom JWT-based authentication system
- Created protected admin routes with middleware
- Implemented CRUD operations for product management
- Added image upload functionality with Supabase Storage

**Key Decisions:**
- **Custom Auth vs. Supabase Auth**: Chose custom JWT for admin-only access and simpler implementation
- **Middleware Protection**: Used Next.js middleware for route protection
- **File Storage**: Integrated Supabase Storage for image uploads with proper RLS policies

**AI Assistance:**
- AI generated the authentication middleware and JWT handling
- Helped implement secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Assisted with file upload API and storage configuration

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes & Optimization

**Common Issues Resolved:**
- **RLS Policy Conflicts**: Fixed Supabase Row Level Security policies for proper data access
- **Image Loading**: Configured Next.js for external image domains
- **Cart State Management**: Resolved session persistence and state synchronization
- **Bundle Stock Calculation**: Fixed complex queries for accurate inventory tracking

**AI Assistance:**
- AI helped debug complex SQL queries and RLS policies
- Generated comprehensive error handling patterns
- Assisted with performance optimization and code cleanup
